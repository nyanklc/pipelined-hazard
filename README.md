# pipelined-hazard
A simple pipelined processor architecture with a hazard unit.

This was an undergraduate level course project, hence the details of the design are not clearly explained here.
The repository contains the entire Quartus project, but it is suggested to look at the individual verilog files instead of cloning this repository.

A Cocotb testbench is also provided (just logs the signals in the design, no assertions).
Requirements:
- cocotb 1.7.2
- iverilog 12.0
